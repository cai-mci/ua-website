        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p> The mission of Urgent Animals of Hearne is to save as many animals as possible in Hearne Animal Control, a catch and kill facility in Central Texas. Every animal listed here are in dire need of a foster or forever homes. 
            We are a network of dedicated volunteers located about 20 miles north of College Station and three hours south of Dallas. Our group was originally formed to rescue pets from the City of Hearne Animal Control, where animals were routinely euthanized for nearly 12 years. Today, our mission has grown to help animals across several surrounding counties.
            ALL of our pets are FULLY vetted before adoption. 
        </p>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
            We operate entirely on donations - we receive no funding from the city, corporations, or businesses. We are not a building, but rather a community of fosters who open their homes to save lives.
            If you would like to know how you can help, please send us a private message. Whether you choose to adopt, foster, or donate, your support makes a life-changing difference.
            95% of the animals we rescue come from Hearne Animal Control, but we assist others in need as well. Please take a moment to check out the available pets and consider adopting, fostering, or donating. These animals need you.

        <h1>Deborah Ann "Deb" Green Fatheree</h1>
        <center><h3>March 30 1954 - September 4 2025 </h3></center>
            <img src= "img/deb1.jpg" class = "wrap-right">
        <p> <b>Deborah Ann Green Fatheree</b>, beloved wife, sister, aunt, friend, and tireless animal advocate, passed away peacefully on 
            September 4, 2025, at the age of 71. She was born on March 30, 1954, in Rock Hill, South Carolina, to the late Calvin S. Green 
            and Dorothy Buckley Green.
            <br><br>
            A woman of fierce spirit and unmatched compassion, Deb became a warrior for the voiceless. Through her rescue work, she saved 
            over <b>4,000 pets</b>, each one a life spared and a family blessed. Her passion for animals changed not only their lives but also the 
            lives of countless people who welcomed them into their homes. Known for her honesty, tenacity, and refusal to shy away from the 
            truth, Deb embodied courage. She was unafraid to ruffle feathers much like the beautiful birds she cherished, Tarzan and Coo-coo, 
            if it meant protecting an animal in need.
            <br><br>
            <img src= "img/deb2.jpg" class = "wrap-left">
            Her impact stretched far beyond Robertson County, where she became a cornerstone of the rescue community. She was a mentor and 
            a steady hand in times of heartbreak. She stood with countless pet owners through the loss of beloved pets, guided them in 
            fostering and adoption, and inspired them to join in her mission of rescue.
            <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Deb will be remembered for her unwavering devotion to animals, her strength of spirit, her candor, and her friendship.</h3>

        <p> 
            Your Donations help with medical costs, including but not limited to vaccinations 
            and emergency treatments, and also allow us to board animals that are at the end of
            their time at the shelter. 
            It's a last resort before euthanasia, but we do not want to see these sweet animals 
            be put down.
