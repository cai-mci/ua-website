        <h2> About Urgent</h2>
        <h3> Saving pets in Roberston County </h3>
        <p> The mission of Urgent Animals of Hearne is to save as many animals as possible in Hearne Animal Control, a catch and kill facility in Central Texas. Every animal listed here are in dire need of a foster or forever homes. 
            We are a network of dedicated volunteers located about 20 miles north of College Station and three hours south of Dallas. Our group was originally formed to rescue pets from the City of Hearne Animal Control, where animals were routinely euthanized for nearly 12 years. Today, our mission has grown to help animals across several surrounding counties.
            ALL of our pets are FULLY vetted before adoption. 
            We operate entirely on donations - we receive no funding from the city, corporations, or businesses. We are not a building, but rather a community of fosters who open their homes to save lives.
            If you would like to know how you can help, please send us a private message. Whether you choose to adopt, foster, or donate, your support makes a life-changing difference.
            95% of the animals we rescue come from Hearne Animal Control, but we assist others in need as well. Please take a moment to check out the available pets and consider adopting, fostering, or donating. These animals need y

        <h2> About the Founder </h2>
        <p>Deborah Ann "Deb" Green Fatheree</p>
        <p>March 30 1954 - September 4 2025 </p>
        <p> Deborah Fatheree of Roberston County spent her time trying 
            to help abandoned animals who ended up at the Hearne Animal Shelter. 
            Limited space within the shelter forced them to put dogs and cats down. 
            Deb decided that something had to be done to help the animals find new homes. 
            Since she started Urgent Animals of Hearne in 2013, there has not 
            been a single euthanization at the shelter. Through her rescue work, 
            she saved over 4,000 pets, each one a life spared and a family blessed.</p>

        <h2>Donate</h2>
        <p> Your Donations help with medical costs, including but not limited to vaccinations 
            and emergency treatments, and also allow us to board animals that are at the end of
            their time at the shelter. 
            It's a last resort before euthanasia, but we do not want to see these sweet animals 
            be put down. You can never imagine how much we appreciate any donation you are able 
            to provide, no matter how big or small. We couldn't help these precious souls without you!  
            Thank you from the bottom of our hearts! 
            Alternatively, you can always call Robertson County Veterinary Services at 979-279-9201 
            and make a donation directly to them.
